    <h3>Available Activites</h3>
    <p>
      Activities that may be completed on my site will include a blog section where customers can review our services
      and hopefully leave a positive testimonial. Other activities may include claiming promotional coupons for tire
      rotation, oil changes, or free air filter installation. There will also be an option to pay with such apps as
      Apple pay, Cash App, or Venmo. Another activity that a customer may complete on my site would be asking questions
      about current issues with their car. This could benefit both parties as it may provide me with valuable
      information about future potential customers and provide the customers with valuable information to make a
      decision on future repairs.

    </ul>
    <h3>Q&A/Testamonials</h3>
    <p>
      Common questions that visitors will expect answers to are how much services cost, how long have I been in service
      and am I insured. Other questions may include what cars I specialize in or what cars specifically can I service. I
      think another question that may be valuable would be my availability or if I offer mobile services. Other
      questions may include payment options.
