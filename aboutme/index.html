<h2>John Autry</h2>
<p>Greetings! My name is John Autry. I am 44 years old and have been married to my high school sweet-heart for 22 years. We have two beautiful daughters, one of which we just dropped off at BYU-I yesterday.
    <p></p>My major is in General Science with a cluster in Automotive Maintanence, Social Media Marketing and Business Management. I have been in the United States Army for the past 15 years and hopefully will 
    make it 5 more.<p></p> While in the Army, I have served in various medical professions to include combat medicine, nursing and my most recent as a critical care fight paramedic. I have really enjoyed attending
    BYU-I. I have really learned a lot about myself, my limits and how I can accomplish anything that I put my mind to. I am excited to continue to add to my knowledge and finish out my college career <strong class=""></strong>
